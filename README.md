How to compile and run programs?
A gradle project has been created. But we will be using gradle features later.

As of now, to compile the class, go to the directory of that particular class and run the below command :
javac <ClassName>.java

Once compilation is successful using above command, run the program using below command :
java <ClassName>

If there are multiple classes to compile, you can compile all of them as follows :
javac <Class1>.java <CLass2>.java <Class3>.java
